; An approach is a specific way of going about:
; 1. Generating color palettes
; 2. Mapping palette colors into neural network inputs

(defn approach
  "Creates an approach with the given palette generator function and input
  mapping transducer. The palette generator function should return a color and
  should have two arities â€“ a 0-arity variant will be invoked for the first
  color being generated, while the 1-arity version will be invoked with the
  result of the previous iteration as a parameter. Think of the process as
  (iterate palette-fn (palette-fn)). The input mapping transducer should map a
  sequence of colors (representing one particular palette) into a sequence of
  floating point numbers."
